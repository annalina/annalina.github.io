<h2 id="additive-manufacturing">Additive Manufacturing</h2>

<p>Industrial revolution 4.0 bring forth a growing trend of employing intelligent manufacturing systems like 3D printing or Additive Manufacturing (AM).</p>

<p>The 3D printer reads a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) file, lays the metal powder for fusion, and the designed product is constructed layer-by-layer. Therefore, we have much control over the design and quality of the final product. Furthermore, based on the application and industry, AM equipment has the flexibility of using a vast collection of materials like glass, metals (steel, titanium, and gold), thermoplastics (polycarbonate, and polylactic acid), and bio-ink (created using stem cells). As a result, AM possesses the potential to reduce energy and material wastage, provide greater design flexibility and extends product life.</p>

<p>We employ <a href="https://aconity3d.com/products/aconity-mini/">AconityMINI 3D printer</a> (see Figure 1). It is a Powder-Bed Fusion - Laser Beam (PBF-LB) system (<em>see Figure 2</em>). An example of PBF-LB process can be viewed at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUhIeMAp3Rc">YouTube link</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>AM using Powder-Bed Fusion (PBF) technique has high potential but are susceptible to process parameters. However, the large amount of data generated by an AM process well captures information of the underlying process (<em>see Figure 3</em>).</p>

</p>

<p>This availability of big data paves the way to employ Machine Learning (ML) and data analysis tools to understand the fault and mitigate any future occurrence.
The manufacturing industry’s adoption rate of ML and analytics to improve predictive maintenance is forecast to increase <strong>38%</strong> in the next five years.</p>

<h2 id="personalisation">Personalisation</h2>

<h3 id="project-1-personalized-retweet-recommendationprediction">Project 1: Personalized retweet recommendation/prediction</h3>

<p>The aim of this project is to use previous users’ tweets in order to predict (or recommend) interesting tweets for them to retweet. This will take as input the user profile and suggests a list of tweets based on two things: 1) the tweets from the accounts that the user follow, this will act as the pool of the tweets that the user will pick one from to retweet, and 2) the historical tweets existing in the user profile, which reflects user interests and will be used in the personalization process. One approach to solve this problem is to extract entities from user previous tweets and add them to a user model. This model will assign weights to the entities and new tweets mentioning the same or highly related entities will be recommended to the user.</p>

<p>### Project 2: Personalized category recommendation</p>

<p>In this task the AI system will recommend one or more categories for the user based on her/his preferences. Preferences will be collected from their previous picks and any other information exists in their profile. Several datasets and domains can be used for this task: Movielens 1 million dataset, Amazon Product search dataset,  Yelp Open Directory dataset and many others. This approach will focus on users with a long history in the system. Several approaches can be followed to solve this problem: probabilistic approaches, matrix factorization methods, machine learning methods.</p>

<h3 id="project-3-category-item-recommendation-for-new-users">Project 3: Category/ Item recommendation for new users</h3>

<p>New users in the system usually have short or no historical interactions to be used in personalization, which is known as cold start problem. It is important that the system recommends interesting categories/ or items for them, otherwise they may have negative impressions regarding the system and may leave it. This task collects preferences from  existing users in the system and uses them collectively to recommend interesting categories/items. Several datasets and domains can be used in this task: Movielens 1 million dataset, Amazon Product search dataset,  Yelp Open Directory dataset and many others. This project focuses on users with very short  profiles. It would be interesting to study if the short profile contributes to the personalization process or only CF models do.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-predictors-of-knowledge-gain-in-informational-search-sessions">Semantic Predictors of Knowledge Gain in Informational Search Sessions</h2>

<p>People interact day-to-day with search engines in order to <em>do</em> or <em>know</em> something, or to <em>go</em> somewhere.
These different types of intents, which are also referred to as <em>transactional</em>, <em>informational</em>, and <em>navigational</em>, usually result in a different
behaviours during the search session.
In particular, during an <em>informational</em> session, the user goes through several phases of query reformulations as they engage with the content retrieved by the search engine and learn more about it.
This project aims at identify semantic features associated with the user’s query reformulation.</p>

<h2 id="point-of-interest-poi-recommendation">Point-Of-Interest (POI) Recommendation</h2>

<p>Recommending POI is a very challenging but also timely and relevant problem. It needs to take into account several factors, such as the person’s preferences and tastes, the popularity of activities in a given area, rates and reviews from other users, but also contextual factors, like user location and time, or the past check-in point during the same day.
This project looks at the problem of POI recommendation by incorporating all the information about the user and the POI in a very challenging setting provided by the Yelp dataset.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-user-embeddings">Dynamic User Embeddings</h2>

<p>A user profile represents the digital version of the user’s experiences, interests, and behaviour. While the richer this representation, the more accurate and useful is the profile for tasks such as personalisation and recommendation, this kind of representation often misses out the dynamics behind the user’s behaviours and how their interests have changed over time.  <br />
This project seeks to find appropriate representations of the user interests capable of embedding the temporal dimension behind the user interaction with the system in the construction of the user profile.</p>

<h3 id="diachronic-analysis-of-language-via-word-embeddings">Diachronic Analysis of Language via Word Embeddings</h3>

<p>Synchrony and diachrony are two different and complementary viewpoints in linguistic analysis. While a synchronic approach considers a language at a moment in time without taking its history into account, the diachronic approach considers the development and evolution of a language through history.
The project aims at defining new word embeddings techniques to perform the diachronic analysis of language.

<h3 id="query-logs-applications">Query Logs Applications</h3>

<p>Query logs represent a huge wealth of information about the users and their information behaviour, i.e. the way humans interact with, seek, and utilise information. They are used for a variety of algorithms behind search engines, ranging from query auto-completion and suggestion to result recommendation and diversification.  <br />
There are several subtopics that may be worth to be investigated in this area, some of them are listed as follows (but feel free to suggest your own topic):</p>
